# package-caboose
Client-side dependency management

To use, copy the source into your project, so that "caboose" ends up inside the 
"third_party" folder of your application.

Then add the package path to your config/.autoload...
    
    $autoload['packages'] = array(APPPATH.'third_party/caboose');
